  "articleBody": "Why I started this blog to practice my writing skills and to document my personal projects. I plan to continue to update this blog with lessons learned from the projects I work on, along with documentation so others can learn from knowledge I have compiled. I hope that, by writing down and double checking my knowledge, I will gain a greater understanding of the topics I write about.\nHow I set up this blog using Hugo and used GitHub Pages for hosting. I also using multiple git repos to make the project management easier. The following will be a step-by-step guide on how to set up a blog like this one.\nTools Hugo is a website building tool that takes markdown files and spits out static HTML and CSS. It is written in go and has a community which makes themes that you can download. Git is a piece of version control software not to be confused with GitHub, which is a website where you can store project managed by the git. I would suggest reading through this guide if you don’t have a working knowledge of git.\nWindows Tool Setup I would suggest using Chocolatey on windows as it makes setting up and managing dev tools a bit easier on Windows. If you do not have Chocolatey already, install go here and follow the deration to get it installed on your computer. With Chocolatey installed, run the following commands, one after another, in an administrator PowerShell/CMD window. This will install all the needed tools.\nchoco install git choco install hugo Mac Tool Setup For Mac, I suggest using Homebrew for the same reasons I suggest using Chocolatey on Windows. To install homebrew on your mac (m1 macs too), run the following command:\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\" With Homebrew installed, you can run the following commands:\nbrew install hugo brew install git Git Setup Before setting up the project with Hugo, a few things need to be setup. If you do not already have one, you should make a GitHub account here. To configure git to work with your GitHub account, we first need to set the username and email to match the ones of your GitHub account. To set the username and email of git, run the following commands:\ngit config --global user.name \"Your username\" git config --global user.email \"Your email\" Git can connect to GitHub by HTTPS or SSH but will connect through HTTPS by default. All you need to do is put in your GitHub password when pushing. However, GitHub plans to remove support for HTTPS at some point, as it is less secure, so follow this guide to setup git to connect to GitHub by SSH.\nProject Setup A few things need to be done on GitHub now. First, make two new repositories. One should be named GitHubUserName.github.io and you should make it public and do not initialize it with any files. The other repository can be named anything, but should be private and initialized with a readme file.\nWith all the tools installed and configured, it is time to build the blog. Open a terminal or PowerShell and move to the directory where the blog project will be stored. Then run the following code replace “sitename” with the name of the site.\nhugo new site sitename Then, change directories to the project directory and start a new git repo, by running the following: Repository 1 is the private repo and repository 2 is the public repo, replace repository1-2 with the GitHub clone address for them.\ncd sitename git init git remote add origin repository1 git submodule add repository2 public git submodule update --remote –merge cd public git checkout main When Hugo builds the blog, it places all of the site’s content in a directory called public. With this setup, we use repository 1 to store the whole Hugo project and use repository 2 as the repo that will be the GitHub Page. If repository 2 was setup correct, the site should be live as soon as a site is pushed to it.\nThe only thing left to setting up the project is picking a theme for the blog. Go here and pick a theme you like. Installing a theme varies a bit so just follow the guide the theme provided for installing it.\nWorkflow A blog with no posts is not much of a blog. To make the first post, start by running the following in the sitename directory:\nhugo new posts/postname.md Open up the postname.md file with your favorite text editor (I would suggest VS Code you can find it here). The postname.md file is where all the content of a blog post will be written (a helpful cheat sheet for markdown can be found here). Most themes also have example sites that you can use their code to understand formatting.\nWith the first post for the blog done, it is time to put it online. First, Hugo will build the markdown and other files into a static site after running the following command in the project directory.\nhugo -t nameOfTheme Now change directories to the public and add, commit, push the code with the following commands run from the project directory:\ncd public git add * git commit -m “Commit Message” git push origin main With that push, you should be able to go to GithubUserName.github.io and see your blog. Anytime you want to make a new post, simply run through the steps of the workflow section again.\nLastly, to commit the whole project to GitHub in order to roll back if you mess something up or work on it from another computer, run the following commands from the sitename directory:\ngit add * git commit -m “Commit Message” git push origin master ",
